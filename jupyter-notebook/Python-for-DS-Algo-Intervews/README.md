# Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews

Here I have downloaded the jupyter notebook to follow along the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews">Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews</a> course in Udemy. This is a further effort to become more effective in my job hunting quest.

# Installing Jupyter Notebook

This was rather easy. Since I am doing this al while ona linux environment (Fedora 36) I already had Python and PIP installed. All I had to do was:

<code>pip install notebook</code><br>

## Run Jupyter Notebook

While on the desire directory:

<code>jupyter notebook</code><br>

This will open up the browser and I will be ready to go over the notebook!
